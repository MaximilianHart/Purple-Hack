# Purple Hack
> [!NOTE]
> *A fair-use amalgamation of AD&amp;D 1e (via OSRIC), *Swords &amp; Wizardry*, and other RPGs into a single ruleset for personal use. The design goal is to combine some meaningful character creation choices from AD&D/OSRIC with the unified saving throw & quick combat of *Swords & Wizardry*, plus some procedures from B/X and some other sources that I enjoy.*

# Character Creation Quickstart

## Roll Your Stats

Roll 3d6 down the line for Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, and Cha. You can swap one set of stats.

## Choose Your Class & Note Hit Die & Special Abilities
*Note: Depending on your race selection, you might be able to multi-class.*

## Roll Quick Equipment
**(Or roll 3d6*10sp and go shopping!)**

*We're using "item slot" encumbrance. Most things are 1 slot, but 2h weapons and medium armor are 2, heavy armor is 3, and coins & gems stack to 500 in a slot. If you cross the line marked on your character sheet, you're encumbered.*

- You start with: a backpack, tinderbox, waterskin, rations x3, torches x3, 3d6sp.
- Armor based on class. Magic-Users have no armor or shield (but get 4d6sp). Thief & Druid get leather armor. Others roll 1d6:
  - 1-2=Leather (AC 12)
  - 3-4=Ring (AC 13)
  - 5=Scale (AC 14)
  - 6=Chainmail (AC 15)
- Choose a weapon option (Clerics can only wield blunt weapons; Druids only wooden; Magic-Users only daggers, staves & darts; dwarves & halflings can't use large two-handed weapons):
  - Option A: One melee weapon & a shield (+1 AC)
  - Option B: One two-handed weapon (+1 damage)
  - Option C: Two one-handed weapons (+1 to hit)
  - Option D: One melee weapon & one ranged weapon (plus ammo)
- Roll 1d12 twice on the gear table below.
- Go shopping with your 3d6sp, if you want.
  - If you're a cleric, be sure to buy a holy symbol!
  - Make a note on your sheet which slots belong to which containers you have (backpack, sacks, etc.). Small sacks require one hand to carry, large sacks require two hands.

## Adventuring Gear Table

| 1d12 | Gear                          | 1d12 | Gear                          |
|------|-------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|
| 1    | Crowbar                       | 7    | 50' rope                     |
| 2    | Hammer (small) + iron spikes x12 | 8    | 50' rope + Grappling hook    |
| 3    | Holy water                    | 9    | Twine (100' ball)            |
| 4    | Lantern + Oil flask x3        | 10   | Vial, glass x3               |
| 5    | Hand mirror                   | 11   | Mallet + stakes x3           |
| 6    | Pole, 10'                     | 12   | Wolfsbane sprig              |

## Note Your XP Bonus (If Any)

+5% XP (cumulative) bonus for each of the following: Prime Attribute(s) 13+, Wis 13+, Cha 13+.

## Note Your Movement Speed

The first number is your exploration speed, the second is your speed in combat.

| Armor Worn               | Unencumbered   | Encumbered     |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Unarmored, Leather       | 120' (40')     | 90' (30')      |
| Ring, Scale, Chainmail   | 90' (30')      | 60' (20')      |
| Splint, Plate            | 60' (20')      | 30' (10')      |


## Check Any Special Abilities You Have:

- **Alertness**: A party with a Ranger is unlikely to be surprised, with only a 1-in-6 chance. A ranger surprises on 3-in-6.
- **Backstab**: When attacking with surprise from behind, the Thief gains +4 to hit and inflicts double damage.
- **Cure Disease**: A Paladin can cure disease by touch once per week (more often at higher levels) and is immune to disease.
- **Detect Evil**: A Paladin may detect evil at any range up to 60', provided he or she concentrates on doing so in the right general direction.
- **Fighting the Unskilled**: Against creatures with 1 hit die or less, a Fighter makes one attack per level each round.
- **Lay on Hands**: A Paladin can "lay on hands" once per day to cure 2hp per Paladin level.
- **Lone Ranger**: Until 8<sup>th</sup> Level & the title "Ranger Knight," a Ranger may not hire or accept followers of any kind. A maximum of three rangers may travel or operate together at any one time. Rangers travel light and may not keep more treasure than they (or their steed) can carry.
- **Paladin Vows**: Paladins may own 1 suit of magic armor, 1 magic shield, and up to 3 magic weapons, but no more than 4 additional magic items. Paladins must give away 10% of any treasure received to some Lawful Good cause, and if any remains after paying costs (like maintaining equipment or paying servants' wages), that surplus must likewise be donated. Paladins will not associate with characters who are not Lawful save under very exceptional circumstances.
- **Parry**: Fighters with a Dexterity score of 14 or better can parry instead of attacking to penalize incoming attacks at the following rate: Dex 14-15=-1 to hit, Dex 16-17=-2 to hit, Dex 18=-3 to hit.
- **Protection from Evil**: A Paladin radiates an aura within a 10' radius, equivalent to the clerical spell *protection from evil*.
- **Thieving Skills**: You're preternaturally good at some things. Roll the number listed or lower on 1d20 to succeed. At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you have 12 points to add to your skills (no more than 6 to one single skill). You'll also add your Dex mod to * skills. If you wear armor other than padded or leather while attempting the * skills or Climb Walls, you have a penalty equal to the number of slots the armor takes. Note: These Thieving Skills are also modified by your race.
  -   *Pick Pockets: 3
  -   *Open Locks: 2
  -   *Find/Remove Traps: 1
  -   *Move Silently: 2
  -   *Hide in Shadows: 1
  -   Climb Walls: 12
  -   Detect Noise: 3
  -   Read Languages: 0
- **Tracking**: Rangers are able to track other creatures, with a base chance of 90% (modifiers in full rules).
- **Turn Undead**: Clerics present their holy symbol in an attempt to "turn" the undead, causing the foul monsters to flee. Higher-level chaotic clerics may choose to control the undead instead of turning them. Roll 1d20, and if the number is equal to or greater than the number below, 2d6 creatures of the targeted type are turned and depart, not returning for 3d4 rounds: Skeleton (10), Zombie (13), Ghoul (16), Shadow (19), Wight (20).

## If You're A Magic-User, Roll for Spells

Read Magic & Detect Magic will always be your first spells; the rest will be random. See the list at right. At level 1, you can memorize one of your spells each day to cast. Also, add a spellbook to your inventory.

| Int     | Starting Spells   | Int     | Starting Spells   |
|---------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| 3-8     | 2                 | 15-16   | 5                 |
| 9-12    | 3                 | 17      | 6                 |
| 13-14   | 4                 | 18      | 7                 |

## Magic-User 1<sup>st</sup> Level Starting Spells

Note that you can learn many more spells than this! These are just the "basics" any self-respecting Magic-User might be expected to know.

1. **Charm Person.** Target thinks you're their bestie and might do what you say. Lasts longer vs dumb targets.
2. **Detect Magic.** You see nearby enchanted stuff glow for 2 minutes/level.
3. **Hold Portal**: Keep a door closed for 2 minutes/level.
4. **Light**: 20' radius light cast on an object or eyeballs (it'll blind a baddie!). Lasts 10 min per level.
5. **Magic Missile**: Auto-hit for 1d4+1 damage. More missiles as you level.
6. **Protection from Evil**: Against creatures of another alignment, you get +2 to saving throws and they get -2 to attack you for 2 minutes/level. Summoned & conjured creatures can't touch you.
7. **Read Languages**: You can read 2 things written in any language.
8. **Read Magic**: For 2 minutes/level, you can read magical scrolls, spellbooks, & inscriptions not written by you. Once you've read something once, you can read it again without recasting this spell.
9. **Shield**: A frontal shield that gives you +1 on saving throws vs frontal attacks, AC 18 vs thrown weapons, AC 17 vs missiles, and AC 16 vs other attacks. *Magic missiles* can't penetrate it.
10. **Sleep**: Magically puts creatures to sleep in a 15' radius. You'll want to read the actual description for this one.

## Note a Motivation or Motto

*Why is your character risking their life for adventure? This can be one word, or a short sentence. Examples:*

- Rejected from his clan, Gorend is on a mission to prove himself.
- Percival always has to be the hero.
- Cedric can't resist a good story.
- Spread the faith
- Earn glory
- Amass wealth
- Take revenge
- Master a skill
- Obey duty
- Discover truth
- Do good
- Help others
- Instill chaos

*Rate of fire is the number of times that a missile weapon can be fired during a single combat round. Longbows and shortbows can be fired two times during a combat round, while a heavy crossbow can be fired only once in a round and must then be reloaded for a full round before it can be fired again.

†Shooting or throwing beyond this range is at a -2 penalty to hit. The weapon cannot reach farther than twice this range. Outdoors, these range increments are tripled.

# How to Play

## Dungeon Exploration

Many D&D adventures will involve the characters exploring some enclosed area, be it the dungeons beneath a castle or temple, a system of natural caves and caverns, an abandoned mine, the sewers beneath a city, an enemy fortress, a wizard's tower, or a shrine to some dark god. For convenience, and by tradition, these enclosed locations are collectively called "dungeons", which thus refers not just to a set of man-made tunnels but to any indoor adventure location. Indoor/dungeon adventures tend to have similar characteristics and thus the same set of procedures and suggested resolution mechanics applies to most "dungeon" adventures. Some terms to know:

**Movement During Dungeon Exploration:** Is at the per-turn rate on your character sheet (the first, large number), and the party is limited to the speed of its slowest member. This slow, cautious move rate allows characters to make a map of their progress, observe their surroundings, hear monsters approaching, and have a chance to surprise them. When passing through familiar areas or following a map, characters can move at up to three times the normal per-turn move rate. Characters fleeing from an encounter may run at ten times their normal per-turn move rate. No mapping is possible while fleeing in this manner, the characters are automatically surprised by any monsters, and the party must rest for a turn at the end of the pursuit.

**Marching Order:** The players should establish the party's "marching order," i.e. which characters are in front, bringing up the rear, and in the middle. In a standard 10' wide dungeon corridor, up to three characters may walk abreast, depending on the weapons they're carrying (see Combat: Spacing & the Second Rank).

**Wandering Monster Checks:** Every third turn (see "Time") (usually), the referee rolls to see if any wandering monsters are encountered (typically a 1-in-6 chance). Excessive noise (like smashing in a door) can lead to additional checks.

**Listening at Doors:** PCs can strain in utter silence to hear anything beyond a closed door (or down a hallway). The base chance is 1-in-6, though elves and halflings have a 2-in-6 chance, and Thieves can have much higher chances. To listen intently takes a turn.

**Open a Stuck or Locked Door:** Upon discovering that a door is stuck, a character may make an open doors check to pull the door open as swiftly and quietly as possible. Each character may only try once. On a failure, the party may decide to work with crowbars or other tools to wrench the door open anyway. This takes a turn and will trigger a wandering monster check. Locked doors need keys, Thieves' tools and a Thief, or a battering ram (or axes). Any failed attempt to open a stuck or locked door will prevent surprise on any creature on the other side of the door. You should also know: Doors tend to close on their own. Iron spikes are invaluable for keeping doors open or closed.

**Mapping:** Maps are usually best made simply: boxes and lines are sufficient to keep you from getting lost. The players' map represents an actual in-game object. If the players at the table are making a map, then a character must also be making one. This has several corollaries: the party must have light (they can only map what they see) and mapping supplies (something to write with and something to write on), they must be moving slowly and methodically (no more than standard exploration speed), and measuring the size of a room takes time. Perhaps most importantly, if something happens to the map in-game, it happens to the players' map as well! If the mapping character dies and his or her body is left behind, if the characters are captured and stripped of their equipment, or if a jet of acid or a green slime destroys the map, the referee should confiscate it. If the party wants backup copies, the players must actually draw them. If the entire party dies in the dungeon, the only way their maps will survive is if copies were left on the surface.

**Search for Traps or Secret Doors:** It's usually best to do this free-form and narratively (tell the referee what you're doing to search). A careful examination of a 10'x10' area or 10' section of wall takes one turn. Multiple characters can search/examine different areas simultaneously. There's a 2-in-6 standard chance of success (4-in-6 for elves and half-elves). Traps neither avoided nor disarmed have a 2-in-6 chance of triggering on interaction by a character.

**The Party Caller:** If there are many players in the party, some groups like to designate one player as "Caller," or party spokesperson, and filter communication through that single player. This role should not default to a "party leader" who gives the other players orders and reduces them to spectators! Rather, some groups may find that by having a single player speak for the whole group, potential chaos of each player competing for the referee's attention is reduced and the game should run more smoothly, improving the play-experience for all involved. Therefore, if a caller is used, he or she should consult with the other players and then report the party's actions quickly and accurately to the referee. The caller can be anyone and need not be limited to, for instance, the character with the highest charisma or social standing. In fact, if the party uses a caller, the role should rotate among the players from session to session, giving each a turn.

## Equipment Wear & Tear

Equipment can be worn down! If you are hit by an attack where the attacker rolled a 20, your armor gains a **notch** of damage. Each notch reduces your AC total by 1. Weapons gain a notch when you roll a 1 on an attack with them. Each weapon notch reduces by one step the damage die you roll with that weapon (i.e. d10 > d8 > d6 > d4 > 1).

Items can be repaired by an appropriate craftsman, costing 10% of the item's original price per notch. Armor and weapons can take no more than 10 notches of damage before they're destroyed.

Magic weapons and armor take ½ notches instead of full notches.

## Falling

Damage from falling is determined as follows: Falls of less than 5 ft do no damage in game terms, falls of up to 10 ft cause 1d6 damage, falls of up to 20 ft cause 3d6 damage, falls of up to 30 ft cause 6d6, 40 ft is 10d6, 50 ft is 15d6, and falls of over 50 ft cause 20d6 points of damage.

## Gaining Experience & Levels

You gain experience primarily through **recovering treasure** and returning it to civilization. 1sp = 1XP.

Each new dungeon room or hex **explored and mapped** per session grants (10 * Dungeon Level) XP (or 10 * number of hexes from the nearest known settlement XP) per character.

**Philanthropy:** Donate money to the poor/church/Crown/guild/tavern to earn 1 XP per 5sp spent. A Paladin's required charity tithe does not obtain this XP.

On gaining the requisite number of experience points, a character may increase in level after completing a period of **training**. The cost of training is 1,500sp times the character's current level, and will take one day times the character's current level. For example, to advance from 2<sup>nd</sup> level to 3<sup>rd</sup> level, a character must spend 3,000sp and two days. These training requirements are replaced for Magic-Users with spell research procedures.

## Healing

A character will recover 1hp per day of uninterrupted rest. 30 days of rest will return any character to full hp.

## Hirelings and Retainers

Hirelings are unclassed zero level characters incapable of conventional advancement by level. We're using the rules & pricing for hirelings in *AD&D (OSRIC)*. Retainers are classed characters, initially of low level, but capable of level advancement, and both are available for hire by the PCs. The number of retainers available in a particular locale depends on the total population and its predisposition towards attracting adventurer types. The referee will inform you whether or not retainers can be found.

Retainers have the following rates:

- Normal human porters/torchbearers: 1sp/day or 5sp per game session. *Will not fight.*
- Retainers: 50sp on initial hire (+50sp to request a class), plus ½ share of treasure. Will be hiring PC's level plus 1-1d4 levels (i.e. somewhere between PC's level and PC's level -3).

Retainers come with a starting equipment pack. Porters/torchbearers come with no equipment. Loyalty is checked after each adventure/session. If a success is rolled, the retainer's loyalty increases by one to a maximum of 11. On a failure, the retainer departs. Equipment purchased by the PC is kept by the PC.

## Light & Vision

A party needs one light source for approximately every three members of the party. For every missing light source, PCs incur a -1 penalty to attack, up to -4. Note that light sources can be seen from much further away than the illumination they shed for those holding them. Approaching light will warn intelligent creatures of the approach of surface-dwellers, perhaps giving them a chance to prepare.

Characters who have **infravision** can see the heat that radiates off living things. Generally, living things will be visible as bright tones, while cool items are gray, and very cold objects are black. It is impossible to read in the dark with infravision; fine detail cannot be perceived. Infravision only functions in darkness and is disrupted by visible light and large heat sources.

## NPC Spellcasting

Non-player characters may be hired to cast spells or perform other services. As a rough guideline, the cost for an NPC spellcaster to perform such service is often sp equal to 10% of the XP required for a caster to attain the level needed to cast the spell (e.g. *raise dead* requires a Cleric to attain 7<sup>th</sup> level, which takes 55,000XP, so the spell would cost 5,500sp).

Sages not employed by a PC will often charge around 100sp to identify a potion, or 200sp to identify a magical item.

## Wilderness Exploration

PCs have "movement points" (MP) equal to miles per day (per-turn move rate/5, in miles) divided by hex size. +1 MP if on a road all day.

Each hex costs a number of MP to move into. Clear = 1, Rough = 2, Very Rough = 3. One MP may "roll over" to the next day, and PCs may "force march" to gain 1 additional MP, but must rest the next full day.

Players may spend MP to have an X-in-Y chance of discovering any hidden features, where X is MP spent, and Y is 4 for clear terrain, 6 for rough terrain, and 8 for very rough terrain. You can spend multiple days to "guarantee" a successful exploration of a given area.

Players may spend MP to have an X-in-Y chance of finding game (1d4xHD rations of food), where X is MP spent, and Y is 4 for terrain teeming with wildlife, 6 is normal, and 8 is sparsely populated. Rangers double the MP spent.

## Saving Throws

To make a saving throw, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or higher than the character's saving throw target number, the saving throw succeeds.

Monster Saving Throws are as follows:

| Hit Dice   | Saving Throw |
|------------|--------------|
| <1 HD      | 18           |
| 1 HD       | 17           |

## Time

Game time is measured while dungeon crawling in turns (a significant span of time roughly equal to 10 minutes). During combat, a round is 10 seconds.

# Combat

## Initiative & Order of Battle

When the party of adventurers comes into contact with enemies, the order of events is as follows:

1. **Check for Surprise:** The referee determines if a surprise roll is required, and if so, both sides roll 1d6 to see if they are surprised by the sudden encounter. On a 1 or a 2, the side is surprised.
2. **Declare Spells:** This is not an option for a group that was surprised; they have to wait until the beginning of the next round. Any character who is going to cast a spell must say so before the initiative roll. If an enemy damages the spellcaster before the spell goes off, the spell's casting is disturbed and the spell is lost. As the round proceeds, the spell caster may elect not to cast the spell without losing it, but may not substitute another action. A Fighter parrying or Cleric or Paladin turning undead must declare it during this phase.
3. **Determine Initiative:** Each side rolls a d6 and the side with the highest result is the winner. One roll is made for each side, not for each individual. If this is the first round and one group was surprised, the other side gets to go first automatically, without having to roll a die. Ties are re-rolled.
4. **Movement and Missile Fire:** Each combatant on the side that won initiative may move, and may fire any missile weapons. Then the losers of the initiative roll may move or fire missile weapons. Darts may fire a second time at the end of this phase. *Note: A Fighter making multiple melee attacks may make their first attack immediately after moving.*
5. **Melee Combat and Spells:** Each combatant on the side that won initiative makes any melee attacks (if in melee range) or casts spells. Spells take effect immediately. Losers of the initiative then make their attacks and cast spells.
6. **The round is complete.** Any remaining attacks are resolved (Fighters, bows, darts, etc.). Repeat from step 2 (Declare Spells) until combat is complete.

## Damage & Death

When a character is hit, the amount of damage is deducted from their hit points. When hit points reach 0, the character is unconscious and must make a saving throw. On a failure, the character dies. On a success, the character will die in 1d4 rounds, rolled in secret by the referee, unless magically healed or aided by another player character. Each PC may attempt to aid once, succeeding on a 1-in-6 chance.

Even after returning to 1 or more hp, the character will remain in a coma for 1d6 turns and must rest for a minimum of one week before resuming any sort of strenuous activity, mental or physical.

Characters who are slain may be raised from the dead if a Cleric of sufficient level is available to perform the casting.

## Attacking from Behind

Any attack made from behind has a to-hit bonus of +2, or +4 if made by a Thief or Assassin. There are only two ways for most people to get behind someone during combat. One is to surprise an opponent and attack from behind during the surprise action. The other is to attack an opponent from behind when an ally is attacking from the front. Thieves and Assassins can get behind a target during normal combat if they successfully hide in shadows, even if no one is attacking the target from the front.

## Cover

Cover is protection behind something that can block incoming attacks, such as a wall or arrow slit. Cover bonuses are as follows: 25% cover: +1 AC; 50% cover: +2 AC; 75% cover: +3 AC; 90% cover: +4 AC. Firing into a melee is considered 50% cover if firing past a dwarf or halfling, and 90% cover if firing past a human, elf, or half-elf.

## Grappling

The attackers (or attacker) make individual to-hit rolls. The grapple is resolved among those who hit: Each combatant rolls their total hit dice. If the sum of the attackers' dice is higher than the defender's total, the defender is completely pinned and can be killed in the next round unless help arrives or the defender wins initiative and breaks loose. If the sums are exactly equal, everyone is struggling, and none of them can attack with a weapon. If the defender wins, the attackers are beaten back and stunned for a number of rounds equal to the number of points by which the defender beat them. Breaking free of a grapple requires another HD contest.

## Invisible Opponents

Attacks against an invisible opponent have a -4 penalty. Powerful magical monsters, or monsters with more than 11 hit dice, will usually be able to see invisible creatures normally.

## Morale

Certain monsters, such as mindless or undead creatures, are fearless and always fight to the death. The majority, however, will not continue to fight a hopeless battle; they will seek to retreat, flee, or surrender. Morale checks are made when a side loses its first casualty and again when they lose half their number in combat to death or incapacitation. Creatures make morale checks individually, not as an entire side.

## Movement Within Melee

A defender effectively blocks an area about five feet across, and enemies cannot move through this area without first killing the defender. A character in melee (within 5') can make a fighting withdrawal, moving backwards at up to half their encounter movement rate. There must be a clear path for this movement. A character in melee can also make a full retreat, turning and fleeing from melee, moving up to their full encounter movement rate. The character may not attack this round; the opponent gains a +2 bonus to all attacks against the character and ignores any shield AC bonus.

## Prone or Stunned Opponent

Attacks against a prone or stunned opponent negate the shield & Dex bonuses, and are made at +4 to hit.

## Spacing & the Second Rank

Only shortswords, spears, and polearms can be used three-abreast in a 10' area. All other one-handed weapons require five feet of room (two-abreast in a 10' area), and non-thrusting two-handed weapons require a full 10' space to wield. Spears and polearms in the second rank of a battle formation can attack by reaching through the first rank.

## Subdual Damage

A weapon may be used to beat down, rather than kill, an opponent. Players must announce the intention to deal subdual damage before attacking, and all damage done to an opponent the players wish to subdue must be subdual damage (not lethal). Not all weapons can deal subdual damage. Subdual damage does not kill, and such points are recovered at a rate of 1hp/hour.

## Two-Handed Weapons and Two-Weapon Fighting

Just as shields improve armor class by 1, fighting two-handed grants a +1 to damage rolls (except for weapons that can only be used two-handed, where this is already taken into account in the weapon's damage), and fighting with a weapon in each hand gives a +1 to hit. (Note that fighting with two weapons does not actually give two separate attacks; it just increases the likelihood of landing a successful blow.)

## Life Energy Levels & Level Drain

Certain monsters, magic items and spells have the power to drain "life energy levels," perform a "level drain," or an "energy drain." If a PC is drained of a life energy level, he or she loses one complete level of experience and is placed at the beginning point of the new level. The appropriate hit die is rolled and subtracted from the PC's current hp.

If the character is multi-classed or dual-classed, then the highest level of experience attained by that character is lost. If the character has two equal levels, then the level lost should be determined randomly. A PC drained below level 1 is slain (and may rise as some kind of undead creature). NPCs lose a level or hit die, as applicable.

# Multi-Classing & Dual-Classing

## Multi-classing

Multi-classing, which is an option available only to non-human characters, is simultaneous advancement from 1st level in two or more different classes. Multi-class characters begin with a single hit die. Each multi-class hit die is calculated by rolling the appropriate die for each class, adding any Constitution modifier, and averaging the result. A multi-classed character is limited to a total of 9 hit dice no matter what combination of classes is used. After reaching 9 HD, the character gains only 1 hit point per additional level.

A multi-classed character acts with the abilities of both (or all three) classes at once, and is subject to all the limitations of each class at once. The more restrictive of any two class requirements applies to multi-classed Dwarves. The less restrictive of any two class requirements applies to multi-classed Elves and Half-Elves. However, Cleric/Fighters may use edged weapons, and elven Fighter/Magic-Users may cast arcane spells while armored. Wearing armor other than padded or leather while attempting Thief skills incurs a penalty equal to the number of slots the armor takes.

Any experience points received are divided evenly among all the classes of a multi-classed character and tracked separately, even when the character can no longer advance in one or more classes. Multi-classed characters do not receive bonuses to experience points, regardless of their Attribute scores.

The saving throw of a multi-classed character is the best available from the different choices, including any bonuses from a character class.

The abilities of a class are gained as soon as a new level is achieved in that class, but a new hit die is not gained until the character has advanced a level in all classes. In other words, a dwarven Fighter/Thief would not gain a "Thief" hit die at level 1/2; instead, the character would receive a second multi-class hit die (the averaged result of the roll of a d10 and a d4) after reaching 2nd level as a Fighter also.

If a multi-classed character reaches the point where one class is "capped," and the character cannot advance in that class any more, the character still gains only a new hit die when both (or all three) levels would have been reached.

## Dual Classing

Dual-classed characters are humans who elect to change irrevocably from one class to another. Humans are more flexible and can generally become more skilled in any one class than non-humans, but lacking the innate talents of the other races, they can only focus upon one class at a time.

In order to change class, the character must have a minimum attribute score of 16 in the Prime Attribute of the new class, and must qualify in terms of normal ability score requirements and alignment restrictions.

The character retains his or her hit points. He or she can use the particular abilities of the original class, but doing so will cause the character to forfeit all experience points from that adventure (as determined by the referee). This restriction applies until the character has advanced in the new class to a level at least one higher than was attained in the original class.

When the character begins the process of learning a new class, he or she gains the abilities of the new class as a first level member of that class, and all experience is applied to progressing in the new class. The character gains no additional hit points until reaching a level in the new class one higher than in the original class, after which time the character's hit points advance as per the new class. A character can never gain more than 9 full hit dice, no matter how many total levels are gained.

Unlike multi-class characters, dual-classed characters cannot perform the functions of several different classes simultaneously. So, for example, an elven Fighter/Magic-User could cast arcane spells while wearing armor, but a human dual-classed Fighter and Magic-User would have to remove his or her armor to do the same thing.

# Classes

# Cleric

Clerics are armored warrior-priests (or -priestesses) who serve Law or Chaos. Most Clerics have a patron deity or serve a particular religion, although the unified power of Law is paramount for Lawful Clerics and has an existence in and of itself. You are a champion of your faith and moral alignment. You might be a shining knight of the faith, an exorcist of demons, or a sinister witch-hunter. Because most of a Cleric's abilities are oriented toward healing and protecting, Clerics tend to play a support role during combat: backing up the front line, but able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the party's Fighters if the need arises at least for a while. As your Cleric grows in power and reputation, the character might establish a stronghold for the faith: a fortified monastery, a soaring cathedral in the wilderness, or whatever strikes the Cleric as the best way to protect and serve a growing flock of acolytes and loyal peasant followers.

> **Prime Attribute**: Wisdom, 13+ (+5% experience bonus)
> 
> **Hit Dice**: 1d8/level (Gains 2 hp/level after 9th level)
>
> **Alignment**: Lawful or Chaotic
>
> **Armor/Shield Permitted**: Any
>
> **Weapons Permitted**: Blunt weapons only (club, flail, hammer, mace, staff, etc.). No missile weapons other than oil or slings.
>
> **Race**: Dwarves, Elves, Half-elves, and Humans may be Clerics.

**Saving Throw Bonus:** Clerics gain a +2 bonus on saving throw rolls against being paralyzed or poisoned.

**Spell Casting:** Clerics cast "divine" spells from a specific list, with numbers as per the Cleric Level Advancement table. Clerics of specific deities might have different lists of available spells, as designed by the referee. Each day, the Cleric selects and prays for a particular set of spells, choosing any spells from the standard list. Once a spell is cast, it cannot be cast again until the next day unless the Cleric prepares (prays for) the spell more than once.

**Turning Undead:** Clerics can "turn" the undead, making them flee from the Cleric's holiness (or, in the case of an evil Cleric, bringing them to heel as servants and minions). The Cleric must hold their holy symbol and roll 1d20 on the Turn Undead Table. If the result is equal to or higher than the number shown, the attempt is successful and the creatures flee for 3d4 rounds, moving away from the Cleric as fast as possible. They will attack a creature directly blocking its escape route, but otherwise may not fight. Normally 2d6 creatures are affected by Turn Undead. Exceptions are Paladins and Type 13 creatures, of which only 1d2 are affected, and results of "D", which affect 1d6+6 creatures.

**Religious Stronghold (9th level):** At ninth level, a Cleric character may establish a stronghold and attract a body of men-at-arms who swear fealty to the character as loyal (or perhaps even fanatical) soldiers and retainers.
