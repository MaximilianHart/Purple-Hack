# Purple Hack
A fair-use amalgamation of AD&amp;D 1e (via OSRIC), *Swords &amp; Wizardry*, and other RPGs into a single ruleset. The design goal is to combine some meaningful character creation choices from AD&D/OSRIC with the unified saving throw & quick combat of *Swords & Wizardry*, plus some procedures from B/X and some other sources that I enjoy.

# Character Creation Quickstart

## Roll Your Stats

Roll 3d6 down the line for Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, and Cha. You can swap one set of stats.

## Choose Your Class & Note Hit Die & Special Abilities
*Note: Depending on your race selection, you might be able to multi-class.*

| Class        | Required Stats | Description                                     | Prime Attribute | Hit Die | 1<sup>st</sup> Level Special Abilities |

| Paladin      | Str 12 Con 9 Int 9 Wis 13 Cha 17 | You're a paragon of righteousness sworn to be Lawful, a knight in shining armor (halfway between fighter & cleric). | Str              | 1d10   | Paladin Vows, Lay on Hands, Cure Disease, Detect Evil, Protection from Evil |
| Ranger       | Str 13 Con 14 Int 13 Wis 14 | You're a defender of the poor, a servant who protects civilization from the evil forces that lurk in the wilderness. | Str              | 2d8*   | Lone Ranger; Tracking; Alertness; +1 damage vs evil humanoids |

**Roll Quick Equipment** * **(Or roll 3d6*10sp and go shopping!)**

*We're using "item slot" encumbrance. Most things are 1 slot, but 2h weapons and medium armor are 2, heavy armor is 3, and coins & gems stack to 500 in a slot. If you cross the line marked on your character sheet, you're encumbered.*

- You start with: a backpack, tinderbox, waterskin, rations x3, torches x3, 3d6sp.
- Armor based on class. Magic-Users have no armor or shield (but get 4d6sp). Thief & Druid get leather armor. Others roll 1d6:
  - 1-2=Leather (AC 12)
  - 3-4=Ring (AC 13)
  - 5=Scale (AC 14)
  - 6=Chainmail (AC 15)
- Choose a weapon option (Clerics can only wield blunt weapons; Druids only wooden; Magic-Users only daggers, staves & darts; dwarves & halflings can't use large two-handed weapons):
  - Option A: One melee weapon & a shield (+1 AC)
  - Option B: One two-handed weapon (+1 damage)
  - Option C: Two one-handed weapons (+1 to hit)
  - Option D: One melee weapon & one ranged weapon (plus ammo)
- Roll 1d12 twice on the gear table below.
- Go shopping with your 3d6sp, if you want.
  - If you're a cleric, be sure to buy a holy symbol!
  - Make a note on your sheet which slots belong to which containers you have (backpack, sacks, etc.). Small sacks require one hand to carry, large sacks require two hands.

---

**Note Your XP Bonus** (If Any)

+5% XP (cumulative) bonus for each of the following: Prime Attribute(s) 13+, Wis 13+, Cha 13+.

**Note Your Movement Speed**

The first number is your exploration speed, the second is your speed in combat.

| Armor Worn               | Unencumbered   | Encumbered     |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Unarmored, Leather       | 120' (40')     | 90' (30')      |
| Ring, Scale, Chainmail   | 90' (30')      | 60' (20')      |
| Splint, Plate            | 60' (20')      | 30' (10')      |

## Adventuring Gear Table

| 1d12 | Gear                          | 1d12 | Gear                          |
|------|-------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|
| 1    | Crowbar                       | 7    | 50' rope                     |
| 2    | Hammer (small) + iron spikes x12 | 8    | 50' rope + Grappling hook    |

| 4    | Lantern + Oil flask x3        | 10   | Vial, glass x3               |
| 5    | Hand mirror                   | 11   | Mallet + stakes x3           |
| 6    | Pole, 10'                     | 12   | Wolfsbane sprig              |

## Check Any Special Abilities You Have:

- **Alertness**: A party with a Ranger is unlikely to be surprised, with only a 1-in-6 chance. A ranger surprises on 3-in-6.
- **Backstab**: When attacking with surprise from behind, the Thief gains +4 to hit and inflicts double damage.
- **Cure Disease**: A Paladin can cure disease by touch once per week (more often at higher levels) and is immune to disease.
- **Detect Evil**: A Paladin may detect evil at any range up to 60', provided he or she concentrates on doing so in the right general direction.
- **Fighting the Unskilled**: Against creatures with 1 hit die or less, a Fighter makes one attack per level each round.
- **Lay on Hands**: A Paladin can "lay on hands" once per day to cure 2hp per Paladin level.
- **Lone Ranger**: Until 8<sup>th</sup> Level & the title "Ranger Knight," a Ranger may not hire or accept followers of any kind. A maximum of three rangers may travel or operate together at any one time. Rangers travel light and may not keep more treasure than they (or their steed) can carry.
- **Paladin Vows**: Paladins may own 1 suit of magic armor, 1 magic shield, and up to 3 magic weapons, but no more than 4 additional magic items. Paladins must give away 10% of any treasure received to some Lawful Good cause, and if any remains after paying costs (like maintaining equipment or paying servants' wages), that surplus must likewise be donated. Paladins will not associate with characters who are not Lawful save under very exceptional circumstances.
- **Parry**: Fighters with a Dexterity score of 14 or better can parry instead of attacking to penalize incoming attacks at the following rate: Dex 14-15=-1 to hit, Dex 16-17=-2 to hit, Dex 18=-3 to hit.
- **Protection from Evil**: A Paladin radiates an aura within a 10' radius, equivalent to the clerical spell *protection from evil*.
- **Thieving Skills**: You're preternaturally good at some things. Roll the number listed or lower on 1d20 to succeed. At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you have 12 points to add to your skills (no more than 6 to one single skill). You'll also add your Dex mod to * skills. If you wear armor other than padded or leather while attempting the * skills or Climb Walls, you have a penalty equal to the number of slots the armor takes. Note: These Thieving Skills are also modified by your race.

<div>

-   *Pick Pockets: 3
-   *Open Locks: 2
-   *Find/Remove Traps: 1
-   *Move Silently: 2
-   *Hide in Shadows: 1
-   Climb Walls: 12
-   Detect Noise: 3
-   Read Languages: 0

</div>

- **Tracking**: Rangers are able to track other creatures, with a base chance of 90% (modifiers in full rules).
- **Turn Undead**: Clerics present their holy symbol in an attempt to "turn" the undead, causing the foul monsters to flee. Higher-level chaotic clerics may choose to control the undead instead of turning them. Roll 1d20, and if the number is equal to or greater than the number below, 2d6 creatures of the targeted type are turned and depart, not returning for 3d4 rounds: Skeleton (10), Zombie (13), Ghoul (16), Shadow (19), Wight (20).

<div>

## If You're A Magic-User, Roll for Spells

Read Magic & Detect Magic will always be your first spells; the rest will be random. See the list at right. At level 1, you can memorize one of your spells each day to cast. Also, add a spellbook to your inventory.

| Int     | Starting Spells   | Int     | Starting Spells   |
|---------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| 3-8     | 2                 | 15-16   | 5                 |
| 9-12    | 3                 | 17      | 6                 |
| 13-14   | 4                 | 18      | 7                 |

## Note a Motivation or Motto

*Why is your character risking their life for adventure? This can be one word, or a short sentence. Examples:*

- Rejected from his clan, Gorend is on a mission to prove himself.
- Percival always has to be the hero.
- Cedric can't resist a good story.
- Spread the faith
- Earn glory
- Amass wealth
- Take revenge
- Master a skill
- Obey duty
- Discover truth
- Do good
- Help others
- Instill chaos

*Rate of fire is the number of times that a missile weapon can be fired during a single combat round. Longbows and shortbows can be fired two times during a combat round, while a heavy crossbow can be fired only once in a round and must then be reloaded for a full round before it can be fired again.

†Shooting or throwing beyond this range is at a -2 penalty to hit. The weapon cannot reach farther than twice this range. Outdoors, these range increments are tripled.
